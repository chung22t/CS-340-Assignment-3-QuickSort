# CS-340-Assignment-3-QuickSort

This program immplements a quicksort algorithm using C++. The program will ask a user to enter a list size (length of list). It will then ask the user to enter the elements of that list. Once the list has been entered, the program will display the unsorted list. The unsorted list will be sorted using the quicksort algorithm method. Once the list has been sorted, the new sorted list will be displayed to the user.

The program consists of 3 files, the main program is "CS340_Assignment3_Part2.cpp".Pre-compiled headers are "pch.h" and "pch.cpp". The pre-compiled headers "pch.h" and "pch.cpp" are included when running the program. The program can be run on any compiler, but when I ran the program, I was using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. 

In addition to the 3 program files, I also included two files displaying the program's output in my repository. One is a screenshot of the output I took when running the program and the other is a textfile of the output.
